### Medium

---

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```
 
### Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
- 0 <= k <= 10^5
