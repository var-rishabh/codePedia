Easy

---

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
